# header one

this is some example text under a header one.
This is some more text. And a little bit more text, I would use lorum ipsum, but google keeps asking me to translate it!

But this is kinda neat yeah? It respects line breaks, and other things, and I can just bang away at writing markdown,
and nothing else!

## header two

*this will be italic*

**this will be bold**

~~this will be strike through~~

__this will be underlined__
